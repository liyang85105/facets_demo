# Introduction

Use [Pair Facets](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) to visualize data.

## Facets Overview

Overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. It produces a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis, and can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets. The tool can process both numeric and string features, including multiple instances of a number or string per feature.

Overview can help uncover issues with datasets, including the following:

* Unexpected feature values
* Missing feature values for a large number of examples
* Training/serving skew
* Training/test/validation set skew

Key aspects of the visualization are outlier detection and distribution comparison across multiple datasets.
Interesting values (such as a high proportion of missing data, or very different distributions of a feature across multiple datasets) are highlighted in red.
Features can be sorted by values of interest such as the number of missing values or the skew between the different datasets.

## Facets Dive

Dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details.
Each example is a represented as single item in the visualization and the points can be positioned by faceting/bucketing in multiple dimensions by their feature values. Combining smooth animation and zooming with faceting and filtering, Dive makes it easy to spot patterns and outliers in complex data sets.
